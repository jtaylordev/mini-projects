Certainly! Building a **Library Management System** using data structures like linked lists and queues is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of these concepts in Python. This project will help you implement real-world applications of these data structures while practicing encapsulation by wrapping data and methods within classes.

---

## **1. Understanding the Core Concepts**

### **1.1 Encapsulation**

- **Encapsulation** is an OOP principle where data (attributes) and methods (functions) are bundled together within classes.
- It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent accidental modification and misuse.

### **1.2 Linked Lists**

- A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Advantages**:
  - Dynamic size.
  - Efficient insertions and deletions.
- **Types**:
  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.

### **1.3 Queues**

- A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle.
- Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).
- **Applications**:
  - Managing tasks in order.
  - Handling requests in a system.

## **2. Designing the Library Management System**

### **2.1 System Overview**

We will build a system where:

- **Books** are stored in a linked list.
- **Users** can **borrow** and **return** books.
- A **Queue** manages the order in which users borrow and return books.

### **2.2 Classes and Data Structures**

- **BookNode**: Represents a node in the linked list of books.
- **BookLinkedList**: Manages the linked list of books.
- **UserQueue**: Manages the queue of users.
- **LibrarySystem**: Encapsulates the overall functionality.

---

## **3. Implementing the Linked List for Book Records**

### **3.1 The `BookNode` Class**

Each `BookNode` will represent a book in the linked list.

**Attributes**:

- `title`: Title of the book.
- `author`: Author of the book.
- `next`: Reference to the next `BookNode`.

**Implementation**:

```python
class BookNode:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.next = None  # Pointer to the next node
```

### **3.2 The `BookLinkedList` Class**

Manages the linked list of books.

**Attributes**:

- `head`: Reference to the first `BookNode` in the list.

**Methods**:

- `add_book(title, author)`: Adds a new book to the list.
- `remove_book(title)`: Removes a book from the list.
- `find_book(title)`: Searches for a book by title.
- `display_books()`: Prints all books in the list.

**Implementation**:

```python
class BookLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def add_book(self, title, author):
        new_node = BookNode(title, author)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
        print(f"Book '{title}' added to the library.")

    def remove_book(self, title):
        current = self.head
        prev = None
        while current:
            if current.title == title:
                if prev:
                    prev.next = current.next
                else:
                    self.head = current.next
                print(f"Book '{title}' removed from the library.")
                return True
            prev = current
            current = current.next
        print(f"Book '{title}' not found in the library.")
        return False

    def find_book(self, title):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.title == title:
                return current
            current = current.next
        return None

    def display_books(self):
        current = self.head
        if not current:
            print("No books in the library.")
            return
        print("Books in the library:")
        while current:
            print(f"- {current.title} by {current.author}")
            current = current.next
```

**Explanation**:

- **`add_book`**: Inserts a new `BookNode` at the beginning of the linked list.
- **`remove_book`**: Searches and removes a `BookNode` with the matching title.
- **`find_book`**: Searches for a `BookNode` by title.
- **`display_books`**: Iterates through the linked list and prints out book details.

---

## **4. Implementing the Queue for User Management**

### **4.1 The `UserQueue` Class**

Manages the queue of users waiting to borrow or return books.

**Attributes**:

- `queue`: List representing the queue.

**Methods**:

- `enqueue(user)`: Adds a user to the queue.
- `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the user at the front of the queue.
- `is_empty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
- `size()`: Returns the size of the queue.

**Implementation**:

```python
class UserQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, user):
        self.queue.append(user)
        print(f"User '{user}' added to the queue.")

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            print("No users in the queue.")
            return None
        user = self.queue.pop(0)
        print(f"User '{user}' removed from the queue.")
        return user

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)
```

**Explanation**:

- **`enqueue`**: Adds a user to the end of the queue.
- **`dequeue`**: Removes the user from the front of the queue.
- **`is_empty`**: Checks if the queue is empty.
- **`size`**: Returns the number of users in the queue.

---

## **5. Encapsulating Functionality in the `LibrarySystem` Class**

### **5.1 The `LibrarySystem` Class**

Encapsulates the book linked list and user queue, providing methods to borrow and return books.

**Attributes**:

- `books`: Instance of `BookLinkedList`.
- `borrow_queue`: Instance of `UserQueue` for borrowing.
- `return_queue`: Instance of `UserQueue` for returning.

**Methods**:

- `borrow_book(user, title)`: Handles the borrowing process.
- `return_book(user, title)`: Handles the returning process.
- `process_borrow_requests()`: Processes the borrow queue.
- `process_return_requests()`: Processes the return queue.

**Implementation**:

```python
class LibrarySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = BookLinkedList()
        self.borrow_queue = UserQueue()
        self.return_queue = UserQueue()

    def borrow_book(self, user, title):
        book = self.books.find_book(title)
        if book:
            self.borrow_queue.enqueue((user, title))
            print(f"User '{user}' requested to borrow '{title}'.")
        else:
            print(f"Book '{title}' is not available in the library.")

    def return_book(self, user, title):
        self.return_queue.enqueue((user, title))
        print(f"User '{user}' requested to return '{title}'.")

    def process_borrow_requests(self):
        while not self.borrow_queue.is_empty():
            user, title = self.borrow_queue.dequeue()
            # Assume the borrowing process is successful
            self.books.remove_book(title)
            print(f"User '{user}' borrowed '{title}'.")

    def process_return_requests(self):
        while not self.return_queue.is_empty():
            user, title = self.return_queue.dequeue()
            # Assume the returning process is successful
            # For simplicity, author is unknown during return; in real systems, we would track this
            self.books.add_book(title, "Unknown")
            print(f"User '{user}' returned '{title}'.")
```

**Explanation**:

- **`borrow_book`**: Adds the user's borrow request to the borrow queue if the book is available.
- **`return_book`**: Adds the user's return request to the return queue.
- **`process_borrow_requests`**: Processes all borrow requests in the queue.
- **`process_return_requests`**: Processes all return requests in the queue.
- **Note**: In a real system, we would need more robust tracking of borrowed books and users.

## **6. Testing the Library Management System**

### **6.1 Initializing the System**

```python
# Initialize the library system
library = LibrarySystem()

# Add some books to the library
library.books.add_book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald")
library.books.add_book("1984", "George Orwell")
library.books.add_book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee")

# Display current books
library.books.display_books()
```

**Expected Output**:

```
Book 'The Great Gatsby' added to the library.
Book '1984' added to the library.
Book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' added to the library.
Books in the library:
- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
- 1984 by George Orwell
- The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
```

### **6.2 Users Borrowing Books**

```python
# Users request to borrow books
library.borrow_book("Alice", "1984")
library.borrow_book("Bob", "The Great Gatsby")
library.borrow_book("Charlie", "Moby Dick")  # Book not in library

# Process borrow requests
library.process_borrow_requests()

# Display current books after borrowing
library.books.display_books()
```

**Expected Output**:

```
User 'Alice' requested to borrow '1984'.
User 'Bob' requested to borrow 'The Great Gatsby'.
Book 'Moby Dick' is not available in the library.
User 'Alice' removed from the queue.
Book '1984' removed from the library.
User 'Alice' borrowed '1984'.
User 'Bob' removed from the queue.
Book 'The Great Gatsby' removed from the library.
User 'Bob' borrowed 'The Great Gatsby'.
Books in the library:
- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
```

### **6.3 Users Returning Books**

```python
# Users return books
library.return_book("Alice", "1984")
library.return_book("Bob", "The Great Gatsby")

# Process return requests
library.process_return_requests()

# Display current books after returning
library.books.display_books()
```

**Expected Output**:

```
User 'Alice' requested to return '1984'.
User 'Bob' requested to return 'The Great Gatsby'.
User 'Alice' removed from the queue.
Book '1984' added to the library.
User 'Alice' returned '1984'.
User 'Bob' removed from the queue.
Book 'The Great Gatsby' added to the library.
User 'Bob' returned 'The Great Gatsby'.
Books in the library:
- The Great Gatsby by Unknown
- 1984 by Unknown
- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
```

**Explanation**:

- Books are added back to the library with the author as "Unknown" since we didn't store author information during borrowing.
- In a real system, we would maintain a record of borrowed books and their details.

---

## **7. Deep Dive into Technical Concepts**

### **7.1 Linked Lists in Detail**

- **Structure**:
  - Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**:
    - At the beginning: O(1).
    - At the end: O(n).
    - At a given position: O(n).
  - **Deletion**:
    - From the beginning: O(1).
    - From the end: O(n).
    - Specific node: O(n).
- **Traversal**:
  - Accessing elements requires traversal from the head node.

**Advantages over Arrays**:

- Dynamic size.
- Ease of insertion and deletion.

### **7.2 Queues in Detail**

- **Operations**:
  - **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Implementation**:
  - Can be implemented using lists, linked lists, or collections like `deque` from the `collections` module.

### **7.3 Encapsulation**

- **Access Modifiers in Python**:
  - **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
  - **Protected**: Prefix with `_`. Suggests for internal use.
  - **Private**: Prefix with `__`. Name mangling to prevent access.
- **Example**:

```python
class BookNode:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.__title = title    # Private attribute
        self.__author = author  # Private attribute
        self.next = None

    def get_title(self):
        return self.__title

    def get_author(self):
        return self.__author
```

- **Benefits**:
  - Protects the integrity of the data.
  - Allows validation and control over attribute access.

### **7.4 Enhancing the System with Encapsulation**

Modify classes to use encapsulation for sensitive data.

**Example**:

```python
class BookNode:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.__title = title
        self.__author = author
        self.next = None

    def get_title(self):
        return self.__title

    def get_author(self):
        return self.__author
```

Modify `BookLinkedList` methods to use accessor methods.

---

## **8. Enhancements and Additional Features**

### **8.1 Tracking Borrowed Books**

Implement a system to track which user has borrowed which book.

**Implementation**:

- **Add a `borrowed_books` Dictionary** in `LibrarySystem`:

```python
class LibrarySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = BookLinkedList()
        self.borrow_queue = UserQueue()
        self.return_queue = UserQueue()
        self.borrowed_books = {}  # Key: book title, Value: user
```

- **Update `process_borrow_requests`**:

```python
def process_borrow_requests(self):
    while not self.borrow_queue.is_empty():
        user, title = self.borrow_queue.dequeue()
        if title in self.borrowed_books:
            print(f"Book '{title}' is already borrowed by '{self.borrowed_books[title]}'.")
            continue
        if self.books.remove_book(title):
            self.borrowed_books[title] = user
            print(f"User '{user}' borrowed '{title}'.")
```

- **Update `process_return_requests`**:

```python
def process_return_requests(self):
    while not self.return_queue.is_empty():
        user, title = self.return_queue.dequeue()
        if self.borrowed_books.get(title) == user:
            del self.borrowed_books[title]
            self.books.add_book(title, "Unknown")
            print(f"User '{user}' returned '{title}'.")
        else:
            print(f"User '{user}' did not borrow '{title}'.")
```

### **8.2 Error Handling**

Implement error handling to manage invalid operations.

**Examples**:

- Attempting to borrow a book that's not available.
- Returning a book that was not borrowed.

### **8.3 Using `collections.deque` for Queue**

Python's `collections.deque` provides an efficient implementation of queues.

**Implementation**:

```python
from collections import deque

class UserQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = deque()

    def enqueue(self, user):
        self.queue.append(user)
        print(f"User '{user}' added to the queue.")

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            print("No users in the queue.")
            return None
        user = self.queue.popleft()
        print(f"User '{user}' removed from the queue.")
        return user

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)
```

**Benefits**:

- Faster and more efficient queue operations.

- **User Accounts**: Implement user registration and authentication.
- **Fine Management**: Calculate and manage fines for late returns.

---

## **10. Sample Menu-Driven Interface**

Here's an example of how you might implement a simple command-line interface:

```python
def main():
    library = LibrarySystem()

    while True:
        print("\nLibrary Management System")
        print("1. Add Book")
        print("2. Display Books")
        print("3. Borrow Book")
        print("4. Return Book")
        print("5. Process Borrow Requests")
        print("6. Process Return Requests")
        print("7. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == '1':
            title = input("Enter book title: ")
            author = input("Enter book author: ")
            library.books.add_book(title, author)
        elif choice == '2':
            library.books.display_books()
        elif choice == '3':
            user = input("Enter your name: ")
            title = input("Enter book title to borrow: ")
            library.borrow_book(user, title)
        elif choice == '4':
            user = input("Enter your name: ")
            title = input("Enter book title to return: ")
            library.return_book(user, title)
        elif choice == '5':
            library.process_borrow_requests()
        elif choice == '6':
            library.process_return_requests()
        elif choice == '7':
            print("Exiting the system.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation**:

- Users can interact with the system via numbered menu options.
- The `main` function orchestrates user inputs and system actions.
