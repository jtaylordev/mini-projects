# Maze Solver

## Introduction
The Maze Solver is a Python application that generates random mazes and finds solutions using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. This project provides a visual representation of maze generation and the pathfinding process, making it an excellent tool for understanding graph theory, recursion, and traversal algorithms.

### Features
**Random Maze Generation**: Creates mazes of customizable size using the Recursive Backtracking algorithm.
**Maze Representation**: Converts the maze grid into a graph data structure for efficient traversal.
**Pathfinding Algorithms:**
**Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
**Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
**Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib to visualize the maze and the solution path.
**Interactive Parameters:** Adjust maze dimensions and choose between DFS and BFS algorithms.

### **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: Generate a random maze and use DFS or BFS algorithms to find a path from the start to the end.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Graphs**: Representation of mazes.
  - **Recursion**: Core to DFS implementation.
  - **Traversal Algorithms**: BFS and DFS for pathfinding.
